.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Bcftools is a toolkit for processing VCF/BCF files, calling variants and
estimating site allele frequencies and allele frequency spectrums.

Convert between BCF and VCF, call variant candidates and estimate allele
frequencies.

.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP 10
.B -b
Output in the BCF format. The default is VCF.
.TP
.B -c
Call variants.
.TP
.B -v
Output variant sites only (force -c)
.TP
.B -g
Call per-sample genotypes at variant sites (force -c)
.TP
.B -u
Uncompressed BCF output (force -b).
.TP
.B -S
The input is VCF instead of BCF.
.TP
.B -A
Retain all possible alternate alleles at variant sites. By default, this
command discards unlikely alleles.
.TP
.B -G
Suppress all individual genotype information.
.TP
.B -H
Perform Hardy-Weiberg Equilibrium test. This will add computation time, sometimes considerably.
.TP
.B -N
Skip sites where the REF field is not A/C/G/T
.TP
.B -Q
Output the QCALL likelihood format
.TP
.B -f
Reference-free variant calling mode. In this mode, the prior will be
folded; a variant is called iff the sample(s) contains at least two
alleles; the QUAL field in the VCF/BCF output is changed accordingly.
.TP
.BI "-1 " INT
Number of group-1 samples. This option is used for dividing input into
two groups for comparing. A zero value disables this functionality. [0]
.TP
.BI "-l " FILE
List of sites at which information are outputted [all sites]
.TP
.BI "-t " FLOAT
Scaled muttion rate for variant calling [0.001]
.TP
.BI "-p " FLOAT
A site is considered to be a variant if P(ref|D)<FLOAT [0.5]
.TP
.BI "-P " STR
Prior or initial allele frequency spectrum. If STR can be
.IR full ,
.IR cond2 ,
.I flat
or the file consisting of error output from a previous variant calling
run.
.RE

.TP
.B index
.B bcftools index
.I in.bcf

Index sorted BCF for random access.
.RE

.TP
.B cat
.B bcftools cat
.I in1.bcf
.RI [ "in2.bcf " [ ... "]]]"

Concatenate BCF files. The input files are required to be sorted and
have identical samples appearing in the same order.
