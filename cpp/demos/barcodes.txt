Barcode file

Each sequence in the library has two ids, the experiment_id and the sequence_id. The experiment_id associates the given
sequence with a particular experimental condition and is appended to the sequence during reverse transcription.  The
sequence_id is a unique identifier on the 3' end of the RNA moleucle.  Both of these IDs are captured in the reads
contained in the first argument to the shapeAln program.  The format of these ids are stored in the barcodes.txt file
and is the last argument to shapeAln.

Example barcodes.txt

> DMS:GACT
[AGCT]{8}AAAGAAACAACAACAACAAC
> SHAPE:GAAG
[AGCT]{8}AAAGAAACAACAACAACAAC
> CMCT:GTTG
[AGCT]{8}AAAGAAACAACAACAACAAC
> NOMOD:CTCT
[AGCT]{8}AAAGAAACAACAACAACAAC


Notice the regular expression in the front of the sequence.  This tells the program where to look for the sequence_id.
The sequence_id's are stored in the library.fa program with the full sequences.

The program begins by creating a map from the ID space to the sequence space
