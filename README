### Building the SeqAN library ###

I only added the makeAln.cpp application to the seqAn library in the cpp directory
If you have trouble building seqAn, take a look at their website. 

http://www.seqan.de/

This worked for me

cd cpp
mkdir -p build/Debug
cd build/Debug
cmake ../../cmake -DCMAKE_BUILDTYPE=Debug

### Example ###

cd ./cpp/example
./run.sh

### Use the analysis script in rpgms to create histograms ####
