In this example you will use the makeAln program to analyze a shape-seq experiment that contains all single and double
mutants of the Addenine riboswitch. 

Step 1: Create a FASTA file with the known sequences of the RNA molecules in your library
    label.pl - Program creates labels from a list of sequences by comparing each to a wild type sequence and identifying
    the position in the sequence that changed.  See how library.lst is converted to library.fast by the label.sh program
    in ./scripts

Step 2: Run a Paired-end sequencing experiment to generate two fastq files.  The first file must contain the
experimental id and the sequence id separated by a constant sequence region.  Examples are given in 

./data/Phix_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq
./data/Phix_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq

Step 3: Create the barcodes.fasta file

If we look at the first sequence in Phix_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq 

------------------------------------------------------------
@M00653:20:000000000-A0RK6:1:1101:19770:2071 1:N:0:1
GAGGCCTTGGCCGTTGTTGTTGTTGTTTCTTTCCTATCCTGGNCGGTCGGA
+
------------------------------------------------------------
we see it is the reverse complement of 

[CCAGGATAGG]AAAGAAACAACAACAACAAC[GGCCAAGGCCTC]

The experiment id is [GGCCAAGGCCTC] and should appear as a FASTA entry in the barcodes.fasta file. An example is given
below. Multiple sequences can be matched to the same experiment id(NOMOD is GCCC and CCAGCGCCTGT) and the ids can have
variable lengths. However, if a smaller length id is contained in a larger id it will be incorrectly mapped. For
example.

>small
GCCC
>large 
GCCCGCATT

barcodes.fasta
------------------------------------------------------------
>NOMOD
GCCC
>NOMOD
CCAGCGCCTGGT
>NA1M7_1
GGCCAAGGCCTC
>NA1M7_2
TATATTTTAAAG
>A1M7
ATGTGCAAGTCA
>NA1M7_3
ACTC
------------------------------------------------------------

The sequence id is [CCAGGATAGG] and should appear in the library.fasta file in a sequence immediately before the
constant region AAAGAAACAACAACAACAAC.

Step 4: Determine the length of the sequence id to match.  You need to input the length of the unique identify for each
sequence.  The program will extract sequences of the identified length from the reads in Phix... and match them to the
library members.


Step 5: Run makeAln.  Take a look at the example add.sh 

Step 6: Plot the output. The condensed output has the format 

output format
------------------------------------------------------------
experiment_id,sequence_id,alignemnt_position,alignment_quality

The expanded format adds the full sequence_id, the ids found in the Phix files, and the full wt sequence. 

The R program plot.r can extract the single point mutations and build a 2D plot of the reactivity for each experimental
condition. 

cd ./scripts
>R
rcmd> source("plot.r")
Images for the analysis are generated and saved in the results directory
